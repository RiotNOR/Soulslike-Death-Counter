# Soulslike-Death-Counter
Death counters for multiple Soulslike games.

Counts and writes your current character's death count to file. Useful for streaming in combination with reading text from file in OBS, or hell - just checking to see how many deaths you had on your current playthrough.

## Usage
Type whatever message you may want the output to be like. By default it just writes out "Deaths {0}" where {0} gets formatted to the value in memory.

Set refresh rate in milliseconds. (1000ms = 1 second)

### Optional ###
Set the output to be saved to a specific file.

Hit "Start".
